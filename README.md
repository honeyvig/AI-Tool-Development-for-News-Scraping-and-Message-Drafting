# AI-Tool-Development-for-News-Scraping-and-Message-Drafting
create a small-scale prototype of an AI tool called "Contact Project." This tool will:

Scrape public sources (e.g., Google News, SEC EDGAR filings, or similar) for updates on 3 specific individuals or companies.
Filter for key updates (e.g., major achievements or changes, not routine news).
Draft a short, personalized message for each (e.g., “Congrats on the big win!”) with a link to the source.
This is a proof-of-concept to test the idea—no fancy UI needed, just functional code I can review. Output can be a simple text file or email draft. I’d like it done in 1-2 weeks.

Skills Needed:

Web scraping (e.g., Python with Scrapy or BeautifulSoup)
Basic NLP or AI (e.g., filtering text, drafting messages—open to GPT or similar)
Ability to explain the work to non-technical staff
Deliverables:

Working code for scraping, filtering, and message drafting
A quick demo or explanation of how it runs
Source code provided at the end
---------
Here's a Python-based prototype for the "Contact Project" AI tool that scrapes news updates for specific individuals or companies, filters the updates for key information, and drafts personalized messages. The steps include web scraping, text filtering, and generating the personalized message.

We'll use the following libraries and tools:

    BeautifulSoup and requests for web scraping.
    nltk or spaCy for basic NLP (to filter meaningful updates).
    openai (or any similar model) for generating personalized messages.

Step-by-step explanation:

    Web Scraping: We will use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape websites (e.g., Google News, SEC filings, etc.) for updates on the specific individuals or companies.
    Text Filtering: We will filter out routine or irrelevant news and focus on key events (e.g., major achievements, leadership changes).
    Message Drafting: Use an AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to generate a personalized message for each individual or company.

Here’s the full code:
Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the required libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk openai

Python Code:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import openai
import re

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Define the target individuals or companies
targets = ["Company A", "Person B", "Company C"]

# Step 1: Web Scraping (Fetching news from Google News or similar sources)
def fetch_news(query):
    url = f"https://news.google.com/search?q={query}&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    articles = []
    for item in soup.find_all('article'):
        title = item.find('h3')
        if title:
            title_text = title.get_text()
            link = item.find('a')['href']
            articles.append((title_text, 'https://news.google.com' + link))
    return articles

# Step 2: Text Filtering
def filter_important_updates(news_articles):
    # Use NLTK to filter out stopwords and tokenize the text
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('punkt')
    
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    important_articles = []
    
    for article in news_articles:
        title, url = article
        tokens = word_tokenize(title.lower())
        filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]
        
        # Filter articles based on important keywords (this can be expanded)
        important_keywords = ['achievement', 'win', 'acquisition', 'partnership', 'announcement']
        if any(keyword in filtered_tokens for keyword in important_keywords):
            important_articles.append((title, url))
    
    return important_articles

# Step 3: Generate Personalized Message (Using GPT or Basic Template)
def generate_message(target, article):
    prompt = f"Write a short, congratulatory message for {target} based on the following article: '{article[0]}'. Include a link to the source."
    
    # Use GPT-3 to generate the message
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Use GPT-3 model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=60
    )
    
    message = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return message

# Main function to orchestrate the process
def main():
    messages = []
    
    for target in targets:
        print(f"Fetching news for {target}...")
        news_articles = fetch_news(target)
        important_articles = filter_important_updates(news_articles)
        
        for article in important_articles:
            print(f"Found important news for {target}: {article[0]} - {article[1]}")
            message = generate_message(target, article)
            messages.append(f"Message for {target}:\n{message}\n\n")
    
    # Save the generated messages to a text file
    with open("generated_messages.txt", "w") as f:
        for message in messages:
            f.write(message)
    
    print("Messages saved to 'generated_messages.txt'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

    fetch_news(query): This function fetches the latest news from Google News based on the query (e.g., a person's or company's name). It scrapes the article titles and URLs.
    filter_important_updates(news_articles): This function processes the article titles, tokenizes them, and filters for important updates based on keywords such as "achievement," "win," "acquisition," etc. You can expand this to include more complex logic using NLP.
    generate_message(target, article): This function uses GPT-3 to generate a short, personalized message based on the article's content. It crafts a congratulatory message and includes a link to the original source.
    main(): This function orchestrates the entire workflow: it fetches news for the targets, filters the updates, generates personalized messages, and then saves the messages to a text file.

Output:

The output will be saved in a file named generated_messages.txt, which will contain the personalized messages.
Example Output in generated_messages.txt:

Message for Company A:
Congrats on the recent acquisition! This is a big milestone for your team. Check out more details here: [https://news.google.com/article-link]

Message for Person B:
Congratulations on winning the innovation award! It's amazing to see your hard work recognized. More info here: [https://news.google.com/article-link]

Notes:

    GPT-3 Usage: The message generation uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API. You’ll need an OpenAI API key to run this.
    Filtering Logic: The text filtering is quite basic and can be enhanced with more sophisticated NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or topic modeling.
    Web Scraping: This example uses Google News. Depending on the structure of the target website (e.g., SEC filings, other news platforms), the scraping logic might need to be adjusted.

This prototype can be easily tested and expanded based on further requirements or additional data sources.
